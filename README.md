LonelyNight
===========

This is the source code for the Singapore Police Force's Android Mobile App, codenamed, Project LonelyNight (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.spf.mobi.ui). I obtained it through a process called "reverse-compilation" or reverse engineering after downloading it from the Google Play Store. The code is written in the Java programming language.

Reverse Engineering is not exactly considered hacking because, no website is compromised by this. In fact because it's software that runs on your computer/device and it's in your interest to know that its free of malicious code. THerefore in the interest of transparency and security, I'm publishing the code here. Even the Whitehouse.gov mobile Apps have published their apps and yet made their source code available (http://www.whitehouse.gov/mobile/)

Technical Details
=================

To understand what's going on, you need tone well-versed in Java/Android programming at the very least.

The system requirements to compile and run this code are the 

- Java Software Development Kit (JDK) ver 1.5 and above.
- Eclipse Software Development Interface (any version)
- Android SDK

Android Development tools run on just about any platform.

Furthermore, you need to read tutorials on how to set-up the development environment on your PC/Mac/Linux.

To run it, just download the .zip file and you can rebuild it. Its still a work in progress, however. When we finally get it running, you will see an .apk file in the main or bin folder. You can then install it onto your device for running. We, however suggest you do not submit this to Google Play due to copyright issues.


Now, my rant
============

So, this dispels the notion that there are not enough Singaporeans who are talented enough or have the right skills for the Software Programming/Security industry.
